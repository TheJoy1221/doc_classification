# Doc_classification

**Doc_classification** is an intelligent document processing pipeline for scanned and text-based PDFs. It uses a hybrid transformer + GPT-based approach to classify documents as **Invoices** or **Other**, with fallback OCR strategies and audit logging.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Multi-fallback PDF parsing: `pdfplumber`, `PyPDF2`, `pypdfium2`, `OCR`, etc.
- BERT-based classification (custom-trained)
- GPT secondary classification refinement
- File sorting & movement into `/Invoices` and `/Other`
- Logs classifications in CSV for transparency
- Configurable via `.env`

## odel Training Notes

This repo includes `train_invoice_classifier.py` to generate your own BERT model.
Ensure `transformers` and `datasets` are installed, and customize the dataset in-script.
